Vegetation Indices for Fire Severity Analysis 🔥🌲

📋 Project Overview

This repository contains Python scripts for computing hyperspectral and multispectral vegetation indices to analyze fire severity. The work is part of a Master's thesis in Forest Management based on Data Science at the University of Valladolid.

Thesis Title
"Fire severity analysis in Sierra de La Culebra wildfire from hyperspectral satellite data"

Academic Context
Master's Program: Forest Management based on Data Science

University: University of Valladolid (Spain)

Thesis Supervisors:

Carmen Quintano - University of Valladolid

José Manuel Fernández-Guisuraga - University of León

🎯 Objective
This research aims to develop and compare vegetation indices from both hyperspectral and multispectral satellite data to assess fire severity in the Sierra de La Culebra wildfire, one of the most significant forest fires in Spain in recent years.
